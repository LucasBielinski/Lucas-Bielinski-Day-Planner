# Bielinski Planner

## Description

My motivation to make this page into a functioning project, was to create an easy way for people to plan their day. I built this project to build on my JavaScript skills and provide an interactive format for interested parties to keep track of their activities. This project serves as a digital reminder to people to complete their tasks, without wasting paper. I learned more about the limits of Jquery, when to use vanilla JavaScript and when to use loops.
