# Bielinski Planner

## Description
My motivation to complete this project was to create an easy way for people to plan their day. I built this project to build on my JavaScript skills and provide an interactive format for intrested parties to keep track of their activites. This project serves as a digital reminder, to people to complete their tasks, without wasting paper. I learned more about the limits of Jquery, when to use vanillia JavaScript and when to use for loops.
